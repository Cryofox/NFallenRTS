/**
 *  Entity's are renderable on the ground, and interactable.
 *  For example: A bow is an entity, so it should be representable on the ground using it's "world sprite"
 *               this sprite is what would be used for inventory management aswell.
 *               A bow is also a weapon and can be equipped. A character wielding the bow may have custom animations
 *               for utilizing the bow.
 *               Ore is an entity, and so it will have an inventory/world sprite.
 *
 *               Humans are not items. They are characters. However once a human is "dead" they will have a unique sprite
 *               to show they are interactable now as if they were an Item. (Inventory)
